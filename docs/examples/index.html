        <h2>Benchmarks</h2>
        <p>
          These examples show differnt implementations of the kausest JavaScript
          benchmarks which has been used for testing and improving the code.
          There are 3 implementations:
        </p>
        <div id="benchmarks">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Benchmark</h3>
              <p>
                This is a stateless implementation where everything exists in
                the DOM. Deleight is used here as a convenient way to build and
                manipulate the DOM.

            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Keyed</h3>
              <p>
                This corresponds to the required keyed implementation of the
                benchmarks where new DOM trees are rebuilt when the data (stored
                in JavaScript memory) are rebuilt.

            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Non-keyed</h3>
              <p>
                This corresponds to the required non-keyed implementation of the
                benchmarks where existing DOM trees are reused when the data
                (stored in JavaScript memory) are rebuilt.

        <p>
          This is an example taken from the 'account' of a discussion site. The
          page will display a profile view if the user is not logged in and it
          will display a login/signup form otherwise.

        <h2>Track-Cycling Game</h2>
        <p>
          The track-cycling race implemented as a computer game. It can be
          played by any number of players. You may choose between random and
          strategic modes. This game is fun.

        <p>
          No 'framework' is truly complete without showing an implementation of
          the famous TODO list application. Our implementation also includes a
          <b>counter</b> for number of items.
