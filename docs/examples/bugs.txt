Earlier lessons:
1. tems(history.children, range(vars.move, history.children.length)) was 
flopping because ... (forgot)
2. querySelectorAll follows the source order irrespective of the selector order
3. Used the same id ('start') for container div and start button.
4. mis-representation of intent to actribute.process leading to destructive overwork.

Documented:
1. the initial player shows O instead of X using this code: `repeat(range(0, players.length))`.
repeat was not materializing given iterable (in case it was a generator). fixed that. also
not actually a bug there but a bug in the display code confusing my interpretation. it was showing 
the index (0) and not the letter (O). the display was supposed to fetch the letter using the index 
but was displaying the index directly.

2. reference error: 'squares' is not defined. it should have been vars.squares.

3. TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 1). arrayVars.squares only had 1 
item. and we were trying to set a value within the second item.
