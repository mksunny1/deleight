# DeleightJS.com

This is a website project to provide a proper 'frontend' for the deleightjs project.
It will be a simple site with the following key features:

1. Provide useful information about using and contributing to the project. This will be enaabled by a 'blog' feature allowing admins to post content which can be interacted with by site users via comments, ratings and other forms of feedback and engagement by the community.

2. Foster a strong sense of community and camaraderie. The community has to grow and thrive because this is an important project for web professionals.

3. Host and explain demos and examples. Examples are very effective and we plan to add lots of these here.

4. Highly interactive and performant UI. As this is a JavaScript project for high interactivity, performance and flexibility, our site should be a correct reflection of these tenets of modern web development practice.

5. All the news and latest information.
