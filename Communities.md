## Deleight Communities

We have a community system largely inspired by [zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig). Everyone is welcome to create or join a community to discuss Deleight. Communities have full autonomy and there is no requirement to function under an 'umbrella'. Nonetheless, we encourage our communities to communicate frequently with us and with eachother forster harmony and share useful information.

Following is a list of communities related to deleight. If you form one, append it to this list with a link and a brief description.
